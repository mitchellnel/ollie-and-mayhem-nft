# ollie-and-mayhem-nft
NFTs of Ollie and Mayhem -- only deployed on Rinkeby

~NFT collection <u>should</u> be visible at https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/ollieandmayhem-v4 but for some reason it's not.~

~The NFTs are visible in my MetaMask though so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯~

The entire collection is visible at https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/ollieandmayhem-v4

### To-do
- [x] Implement basic NFT smart contract functionality
- [ ] Add uniqueness
- [ ] Create web application to allow users to mint easily
